Code to Solve Wordle 

## How to Use

1) Obtain a copy `csw2019.txt` (a list of Collins Scrabble Words), and place it in this folder (top-level directory of this repo). Since this list is under copyright, it is not included in this repo. Feel free to use any alternate plaintext dictionary that has one word per line (and no definitions), but keep in mind if it does not match the Wordle dictionary, the results may not be accurate.

2) Ensure you have python >= 3.10 and open `wordle.ipynb` for example usage.

## Warnings

This is for fun, don't use it to cheat.
